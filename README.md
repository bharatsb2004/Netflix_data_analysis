# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Data Analysis using Python and Pandas
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset using Python, focusing on understanding content trends, release patterns, genre preferences, and more. The project utilizes powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries to derive insights that can be useful for business decisions and content strategy.

The goal of this project is to analyze Netflixâ€™s catalog using various EDA techniques in Python. The analysis helps answer key business questions like:

What types of content dominate Netflix?

How has content release changed over the years?

Who are the top contributors in terms of directors and actors?

How are content types distributed across countries?
